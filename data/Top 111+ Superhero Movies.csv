I got goosebumps, I cried like a baby in the end, laughed at the funny scenes and shouted approvement when it was necessary.

The time travel story brings us to loved scenes from other movies just as well as some quotes and this biggest crossover ever makes me so incredibly happy. I have to admit, there are holes in the logic since everything could've gone way smoother with the existence of Captain Marvel (it's the same problem with every universe that has Superman in it) and that's the only reason I won't give it a 10/10, even if I don't even mind that shortcoming.

Furthermore it presents awful hectic cuts and even awfuler ""special effects"" - not to forget the way too handy gadgets like BatIceSkates... It's funny to see George Clooney of all people take the place of Val Kilmer while all other actors staying the same (Alfred, Robin). Also fun: The Lionel Luthor actor from Smallville as creator of Bane.

You have the names in there, Piccolo is green, but that's basically it. Goku and Bulma were casted Caucasian, while his grandfather, Yamcha, Chi-Chi and Muten Roshi are Asian, which was also kind of weird. Goku is an even skinnier boy than Venom was in Spider-Man 3 and he has just NOTHING of the real Goku. Instead, they turned his storyline into a teenie lovestory. Also there is way too little actual fighting. It's very obviously based on Dragonball (not Dragonball Z), where there still was real fighting and not so much energy balls shooting, where the Red Ribbon army was a huge interesting element and much of all the World Tournament...
